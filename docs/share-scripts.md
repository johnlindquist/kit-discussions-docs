## Get Featured

Featured scripts are displayed in:

- The `hot` tab of the Script Kit main window
- On the [Community Scripts](https://www.scriptkit.com/scripts) page

To get featured, post your script to the [Script Kit Github discussions Share page](https://github.com/johnlindquist/kit/discussions/categories/share). With a script focused in the Script Kit main window, you can press right or <kbd>cmd+k</kbd> to bring up a share menu which will automatically walk you through creating a shareable post for the script.

As a shortcut, hit <kbd>cmd+s</kbd> with a script selected to automatically run the "Share as Discussion" process.

## Share as a Gist, Link, URL, or Markdown

The Script Kit main window also includes many other share options:

- Share as Gist <kbd>cmd+g</kbd>: Creates as Gist of the selected script, then copies the URL to the clipboard
- Share as Link <kbd>opt+s</kbd>: Creates a private installable kit://link to the selected script, then copies the URL to the clipboard. These links are very long as they encode the entire script into the URL.
- Share as URL <kbd>opt+u</kbd>: Creates a Gist of the selected script, then copies an installable public URL to the clipboard
- Share as Markdown <kbd>cmd+m</kbd>: Copies the selected script as a Markdown snippet to the clipboard
