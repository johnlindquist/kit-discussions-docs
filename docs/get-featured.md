## Get Featured

Featured scripts are displayed in:

- The `hot` tab of the Script Kit main window
- On the [Community Scripts](https://www.scriptkit.com/scripts) page

To get featured, post your script to the [Script Kit Github discussions Share page](https://github.com/johnlindquist/kit/discussions/categories/share). With a script focused in the Script Kit main window, you can press right or <kbd>cmd+k</kbd> to bring up a share menu which will automatically walk you through creating a shareable post for the script.
